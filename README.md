## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to develop an autonomous RoboMaster EP robot capable of:

- Navigating to a hockey stick.
- Picking up the hockey stick using the robotic arm and gripper.
- Navigating toward a known puck location.
- Positioning itself for a shot.
- Shooting the puck into a goal.
- Avoiding neighboring robots during navigation.

The system was implemented using ROS2 and OptiTrack motion capture feedback.

## Finite State Machine

The robot behavior was implemented using a finite state machine:

```text
GET_CHECKPOINT
        ↓
GET_STICK
        ↓
GRAB_STICK
        ↓
GET_GOAL_FAR
        ↓
GET_GOAL_NEAR
        ↓
SWING_SHOT
        ↓
DONE
```

### State Description

**GET_CHECKPOINT**  
Navigate to an intermediate waypoint near the hockey stick.

**GET_STICK**  
Perform the final approach toward the hockey stick.

**GRAB_STICK**  
Execute the arm extension, gripper closure, arm lifting, and reverse motion sequence.

**GET_GOAL_FAR**  
Navigate toward a waypoint near the goal.

**GET_GOAL_NEAR**  
Move into the final shooting configuration.

**SWING_SHOT**  
Rotate rapidly to transfer momentum through the hockey stick and strike the puck.

**DONE**  
Stop all robot motion.

## Approximate Linearization Controller

The RoboMaster EP was modeled as a unicycle robot.

### Virtual Point

A virtual point located in front of the robot was used to simplify control design.

```math
p_x=x+l\cos\theta
```

```math
p_y=y+l\sin\theta
```

### Proportional Controller

```math
u_x=k_p(x_d-p_x)
```

```math
u_y=k_p(y_d-p_y)
```

### Control Inputs

```math
v=u_x\cos\theta+u_y\sin\theta
```

```math
\omega=\frac{-u_x\sin\theta+u_y\cos\theta}{L_s}
```

### Parameters

- Control Frequency: **50 Hz**
- Proportional Gain: **kp = 1.2**
- Linear Velocity Limit: **±0.5 m/s**
- Angular Velocity Limit: **±1.0 rad/s**

## Stick Pickup Strategy

The stick pickup sequence consisted of the following actions:

1. Extend the robotic arm.
2. Close the gripper.
3. Lift the hockey stick.
4. Reverse the robot to create clearance.

A timer-based state machine was used to coordinate the arm and gripper actions.

---

## Custom Arm Simulation

Since testing time with the physical RoboMaster EP was limited, a custom arm simulator was developed using the measured dimensions of the robot arm and gripper.

The simulator was used to:

- Verify workspace reachability.
- Validate gripper placement.
- Test pickup configurations.
- Reduce hardware debugging time.

### Forward Kinematics

```math
x_e=L_1\cos\theta_1+L_2\cos(\theta_1+\theta_2)
```

```math
y_e=L_1\sin\theta_1+L_2\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)
```

---

## CLF-CBF-QP Obstacle Avoidance

To provide collision-free navigation, a CLF-CBF-QP-inspired controller was integrated with the navigation system.

### Barrier Function

```math
h_i=(p_x-x_i)^2+(p_y-y_i)^2-d_{safe}^2
```

### Safety Constraint

```math
\dot{h}_i+\gamma h_i \ge 0
```

Negative CBF values indicate that the robot is moving toward an unsafe region.

### Optimization Problem

```math
u^*=\arg\min_u ||u-u_{nom}||^2
```

subject to

```math
\dot{h}_i+\gamma h_i \ge 0
```

A projection-based safety filter was implemented to generate safe control actions while preserving waypoint-tracking performance.

## Simulation Enhancements

The provided simulation environment was extended to include:

- Hockey stick visualization
- Hockey puck visualization
- Goal visualization
- Obstacle robots
- Safety circles
- Robot trajectory plotting
- Custom arm simulation

These additions significantly simplified controller development and debugging.
